# Abtract
FlagQuest Africa is an application designed to test users' knowledge of African flags. The app has an interactive quiz experience, challenging users to identify and recognize the flags of various African nations. Moreover, FlagQuest Africa app includes a "Save for Later" feature, enabling users to bookmark flags they find particularly challenging or interesting. Saved flags are stored in a dedicated section, allowing users to revisit and test their knowledge of those specific flags at their convenience.

# Tech:
- JavaScript
- React
- React Router
- React PropTypes
- Cypress Testing
- HTML
- CSS

# Wins/Challenges
- One challenge I faced was making the the app responsive to different sixed screens in the saved page. When there were no saved flags the h2 was attached to the containers grid styling. I was able to implement useLocation to dynamically change className based on what route the user was on and if there were saved flags.
- When faced with functionality issues due to state mismanagement, I proactively implemented Proptypes. This move proved invaluable as it helped me identify a critical error where I was passing an undefined value as an array in one route. Thanks to this implementation, I efficiently debugged the issue and ensured the proper handling of data throughout the app.

# Plans For Future
- Enable users to choose multiple regions worldwide for flag knowledge.
- Implement Typescript for enhanced code maintainability.
- Develop a tracker for consecutive correct flag identifications by users.
